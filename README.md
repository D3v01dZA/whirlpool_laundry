# whirlpool_laundry

Heavily copied from https://github.com/jdeath/maytag_dryer_homeassistant
Added config flow, async calls, and automatic discovery of SAID

Copy whirlpool_laundry folder into the custom_components folder, restart HA, add whirlpool_laundry via UI and config flow.

Official laundry support is comming to the Whirlpool integration soon (Hopefully 2023.3).
